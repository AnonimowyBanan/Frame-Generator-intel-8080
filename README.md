# Frame-Generator-intel-8080
<h2>Application in assembly language that generate frame on the screen with given char and width.</h2>
At first you have to enter char that you want to be a content of our frame.</br>
(For example, I putted '#').
Next step is enter width of frame that you want to generate.
(For example, I putted 3).
<img width="666" alt="4" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67584450/167301719-505ea788-e20a-4fb6-b0b8-9bf4c6d44b08.PNG">
After a few seconds we can see your frame generated! 

That was my first application that I ever made in assembly language :P
